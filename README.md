# Image-To-Image-Prompts

A personal prompt library for image-to-image transformations.

## About

This repository contains a collection of prompts for image-to-image transformations, primarily created for my own use. At the time of writing (November 2025), these prompts are being used primarily with Nano Banana 2.5.

## Contents

The prompts are organized by transformation type:

- `artifact-removal/` - Prompts for removing unwanted elements from images
- `background-editing/` - Prompts for background modifications
- `color/` - Color adjustment and transformation prompts
- `subject-separation/` - Prompts for isolating and separating subjects
